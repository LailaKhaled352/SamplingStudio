## Introduction:
A desktop application to illustrate and visualize signal sampling and recovery, aliasing and sampling error.

## Core Features:
### Signal Sampling:
Load, visualize, and sample a mid-length signal (approx. 1000 points).

Display sampling frequency in both actual and normalized forms (0×fmax to 4×fmax).

### Reconstruction:
Recover the original signal using three methods: Whittaker-Shannon , DB-3 Wavelet, and Zero-order interpolation

### Four interactive graphs for:
Original Signal: Shows sampled points as markers.

Reconstructed Signal: Displays the recovered signal.

Error Visualization: Displays the difference between original and reconstructed signals.

Frequency Domain Analysis: Identifies aliasing effects.

### Signal Composer:
Load signals from files or compose signals using a built-in mixer.
Add multiple sinusoidal components with adjustable frequencies and magnitudes.
Modify or remove signal components dynamically.

### Additive Noise Control:
Add noise to the signal with customizable Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).
Visualize the impact of noise on different signal frequencies.

### Real-Time Updates:
All changes in sampling, recovery, and noise adjustments update in real-time.

### Pre-Prepared Testing Scenarios:
Three example signals demonstrating different sampling scenarios.
